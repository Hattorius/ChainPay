# Installation

To get started, simply install the SDK. This package includes everything you
need to begin. However, we recommend using [viem.sh](https://viem.sh/) for an
optimized experience.

```bash
npm i chainpay
```

For further guidance, refer to the example and API documentation, which cover
all essential details.
