This ABI defines the functions, events, and data structures used to interact
with the ChainPay contract on the blockchain.

## Usage

This constant is essential for interacting with the ChainPay smart contract
programmatically, as it allows you to encode and decode data for contract
function calls and events.

For a practical example of how the ABI is used,
