# constants

Below are the current constants exported by the ChainPay library. These values
may change with updates, which is why they are included with the library.

## `WRAPPED_BNB`

The contract address of the wrapped native currency. Currently, this is only
deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), so it is hardcoded as "BNB".

## `CHAINPAY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

The contract address of the ChainPay smart contract.
