# Roadmap

ChainPay has significant potential for growth in the future. While much of this
has already been outlined on the homepage, I'd like to reiterate and expand on
those ideas here.

## Version 0.1 (Current Version)

- Backend APIs for developers to integrate payment creation functionality
- Payment support for selected tokens using specific PancakeSwap pools
- Accept payments to both wallets and smart contracts
- Basic documentation and examples for developer integration
- Demo widget for testing payment functionality

## Version 0.2 (Next Version)

- Allow smart contracts to initiate and send payments
- Expand support for additional tokens and liquidity pools
- Support multi-hop swaps for more efficient token conversion
- Implement basic logging and transaction monitoring for payment tracking
- Upgrade developer documentation with code snippets and SDK examples

## version 0.3

- Deploy ChainPay on additional EVM-compatible blockchains (e.g., Ethereum,
  Polygon, Avalanche)
- Expand supported tokens and pools across new chains
- Integrate gas fee optimization mechanisms for cost-effective transactions
- Provide detailed transaction analytics for developers (e.g., success rates,
  swap efficiency)

## Version 1.0 (The Ultimate Goal)

- Introduce cross-chain payment support utilizing bridges for seamless
  multi-chain interactions
- Allow payment batching to reduce transaction costs (e.g., aggregate multiple
  payments into a single transaction)
- Implement customizable fee structures for projects integrating ChainPay (e.g.,
  revenue sharing or flat fees)
- Launch a governance mechanism to enable the community to vote on new features
  and supported chains??
- Security audit by a third-party provider to ensure contract robustness
